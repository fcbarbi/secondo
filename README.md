# README

This is a lab project to keep updated with the latest version of Ruby on Rails (RoR). 

Notes
=====

1. I recommend the use of **rbenv** (an alternative to RVM) to manage the environment for gem installation. According to https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv "at a high level, rbenv intercepts Ruby commands using shim executables injected into your PATH, determines which Ruby version has been specified by your application, and passes your commands along to the correct Ruby installation."

2. I am using tips from Rob Race's book **Build a SaaS App in Ruby on Rails 5** (https://buildasaasappinrails.com/).
